The goal of acoustic scene classification is to classify a test recording into one of the predefined ten acoustic scene classes.
MFCC features and spectogram is used to do the classification.The models used for implementing the acoustic sound classification are ANN,CNN,RNN and CRNN and the accuracy of all different architectures are compared.


The development dataset for this task is TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile, development dataset. The dataset contains recordings from 12 European cities in 10 different acoustic scenes using 4 different devices.
